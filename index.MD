# Routine job...
We are spending a lot of time for routine especially if our job depends and related with Data and sometimes even BigData.
Off course we can delegate some job to our teammates but if this job is routine teammate will dump it back or moreover he will decide to find other team.
Routine killing our time, our productivity and blurs out our willing to achievement new goals. And we need to deal with it somehow.
Sometime you could say: I am doing some routine job only once a week an spending on it about 1 hour it's not to much, I can deal with it. 
Well, maybe... But if you will calculate it even for 1 year: 1h routine job a week  * 4 weeks * 12 months = 48 hour a year.
I think in 21st Century most of rutine jobs should be automated. Let's try to do it...


# About flowStep
It's "micro-framework" which aim to eliminate routine jobs.

Every single job can be segregated by multiple steps. All steps can be grouped by step group and can be run consequentially or parallel.
Typical routine job sample is extracting some data from database and composing excel file. Sometime we need extract from one table sometime from multiple.
The situation get worse when we need to extract data from multiple tables or some date periods or even from different sources like RDBMS, NoSql, Rest API, etc. 

flowStep provides you lightweight modules which will help to extract or import from different sources or consumers and more over it will give you ability to create different routine job scenarios on the fly.
